Migrating to CDAT-5.0 full release
==================================

I have applied a patch to libcdms to unify it with cdat-5.0 (excluding
cdunifpp which is out of date in the CDAT trunk).  

TODO
----

Before cdat_lite-5.0-0.3 I should:

 1. Support "setup.py develop".   This will require rearranging the package layout in "Packages" [DONE]
 2. Support NetCDF4.  I need to investigate what support CDAT-5.0 has and merge.
 3. All tests passing.  2 tests are failing at the moment but I'm not sure if this is CDAT's problem or mine.  Some cdms tests aren't ported yet.

 4. The cdms2.CdunifFile API has changed!  CdmsFile.dimensions no longer exists.  This will require changes to csml and other software.

Supporting NetCDF4
------------------

Some initial investigation suggests the following changes will be needed to support NetCDF4 with embedded OPeNDAP support:

 1. netcdf-4.0.1 library (beta) -- this is the first with embedded DAP support.
 2. Configure libcdms with --with-hdf5lib --disable-hdf and --disable-drs (hdf5 is needed for netcdf4 but we aren't building hdf4 support).
 3. Set linked libraries as ['cdms', 'nc-dap', 'hdf5', 'hdf5_hl'] in setup_util.py.

This will get cdms2 opening DAP URLs but there are bugs connecting to pydap servers.  More playing needed.
