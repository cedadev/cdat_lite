Migrating to CDAT-5.0 full release
==================================

I have applied a patch to libcdms to unify it with cdat-5.0 (excluding
cdunifpp which is out of date in the CDAT trunk).  

TODO
----

 1. Tests are failing on latest 64-bit ubuntu.

Test switching
--------------

All tests that should pass on all systems are called test_* or Test*
as per the usual nose discovery rules.  Tests that are known to fail
but identify bugs that need fixing are in modules called [Ff]ull[Tt]est*.
setup.cfg has settings to run all tests whereas "nosetests cdat_lite"
on an egg will run the reduced test suite.

Supporting NetCDF4
------------------

setup.py will detect if you are using NetCDF4 and look for the HDF5 libraries if necessary.

OPeNDAP Support
---------------

OPeNDAP support can be enabled via the latest NetCDF4 beta without
configuring it in libcdms/configure.  Therefore
cdat_info.CDMS_INCLUDE_DAP is always 'no' even if DAP is enabled.

Buildbot
--------

I'm trying to automate the build process with buildbot.  Checkins will
be automatically build on esg-dev1.badc.rl.ac.uk
