This source distribution allows you to build the core CDAT components
(cdms, cdutil, genutil, unidata and a couple of other packages) as a
python egg.

== What you need ==

1. A python 2.4 installation with distutils installed.  You cannot
   build or run the egg without distutils.  If your python has been
   installed by a unix package manager then you may have to install
   the python-devel package.
   
  To test do the following:

    $ python
    
    Python 2.4.1 (#1, Sep 13 2005, 00:39:20)
    [GCC 4.0.2 20050901 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import distutils
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    ImportError: No module named distutils
    >>>

  Here you are unlucky and need to install python-devel.

2. An internet connection.  The setup script will attempt to download
   the setuptools egg.  If you don't have web access setup.py will tell
   you where to get the file you need.

3. Standard GNU development environment, including make (some linux
   distributions don't install this by default, e.g. Ubuntu).

4. Numeric.  Setuptools currently has problems automatically installing
   the Numeric package so we assume it's already installed.

== Procedure ==

1. Run the setup.py script, passing it the bdist_egg command:

  $ python setup.py bdist_egg

  The setuptools egg will be downloaded to the distribution directory.
  Libcdms will be built and the core cdat packages will be built and
  packeged into an egg in the dist subdirectory.

2. Add eggs to your python path

  $ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/setuptools-*.egg:$PWD/dist/cdat_lite-*.egg

  You need to expand the wildcards manually as python won't do it for
  you.  Naturally you can move the eggs to anywhere you like.

That's it!  You should be able to import cdms and open NetCDF and PP files.
