# UNSUPPORTED PACKAGE

The cdat-lite package is no longer supported.  Existing versions are still available here but we do not plan to develop it further or support its use.

This change is mainly because the installation of the full CDAT is now more straightforward than was the case at the time when cdat-lite was started.

The recommended procedure for installing CDAT is to install it into a conda environment, and is described at https://github.com/CDAT/cdat/wiki/install


The original README for this package can be found in the file README.orig
