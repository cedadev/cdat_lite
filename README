If you want to use the cdms module from within a pre-existing python
installation without installing the rest of cdat and without disturbing
the python installation this is for you.

Here's what to do:
  1. get cdat-4.0b3-cdat.tar.gz from cdat website
  2. unpack this package into the cdat-4.0b3 directory
  3. $ cd mini-install
  4. $ python setup.py install --netcdf-prefix=<ncprefix> --home=<prefix>
     where prefix is the directory where you'd like to install the cdms
     packages.
  5. $ export PYTHONPATH=<prefix>/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
  6. enjoy.

By default libcdms is built with only netcdf support.

You will need Numeric installed in you python distribution and both
the Numeric and Python header files accessible.  If these headers
aren't in standard places you will need to edit the
cdat-4.0b3/Packages/*/setup.py files in the packages you want to
include these directories.  See the python distutils documentation for details.
